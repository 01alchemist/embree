  \section intro Introduction

Embree is a collection of high-performance ray tracing kernels,
developed at Intel. The target user of Embree are graphics application
engineers that want to improve the performance of their application by
leveraging the optimized ray tracing kernels of Embree. The kernels
are optimized for photo-realistic rendering on the latest IntelÂ®
processors with support for SSE, AVX, AVX2, and the 16-wide Xeon Phi(r)
vector instructions. Embree supports runtime code selection to choose
the traversal and build algorithms that best matches the instruction
set of your CPU. Embree is released as Open Source under the Apache
2.0 license.

Embree supports applications written with the Intel SPMD
Programm Compiler (ISPC, <a
 href="http://ispc.github.com">http://ispc.github.com</a>) by
providing an ISPC interface to the core ray tracing algorithms. This
makes it possible to write a renderer in ISPC that leverages SSE, AVX,
AVX2, and Xeon Phi(r) instructions without any code change. ISPC also
supports runtime code selection using the multi-target feature. This
way it is possible to let ISPC select at runtime the best code path
for your application, while Embree selects the optimal code path for
the ray tracing algorithms.

Embree contains algorithms optimized for incoherent workloads (e.g.
Monte Carlo ray tracing algorithms) and coherent workloads
(e.g. primary visibility and hard shadow rays). For standard CPUs, the
single-ray traversal kernels in Embree provide the best performance
for incoherent workloads and are very easy to integrate into existing
rendering applications. For Xeon Phi(r), a renderer written in ISPC using
the optimized hybrid ray/packet traversal algorithms have shown to
perform best and requires writing the renderer in ISPC. In general for
coherent workloads, ISPC outperforms the single ray mode on each
platform. Embree also supports dynamic scenes by implementing high
performance spatial index structure construction algorithms.

In addition to the ray tracing kernels, Embree provides some tutorials
(see \ref embree_tutorials) to demonstrate how to use the Embree
API. More documentation about the API is found in
embree/include/embree2/rtcore.h as well as in \ref embree_api .

The sample path tracer that was originally included in the embree
kernel package is now available in a separate GIT repository (see
\ref embree_path_tracer).

How embree is built depends on what platform you are using.
Detailed instructions for building Embree on Linux, Windows, and MacOS
can be found in section \ref building_embree .

As of version 2.1, the \ref embree_path_tracer that used to come with
earlier versions of Embree is no longer included in the main branch
used for the kernels, and has been moved to a separate branch
dedicated to this path tracer. More information can be found here: \ref embree_path_tracer .
