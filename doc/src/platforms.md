Supported Platforms
-------------------

Embree supports Windows (32\ bit and 64\ bit), Linux (64\ bit) and Mac
OS\ X (64\ bit). The code compiles with the Intel Compiler, the
Microsoft Compiler, GCC and CLANG. Using the Intel Compiler improves
performance by approximately 10%. Performance also varies across
different operating systems. Embree is optimized for Intel CPUs
supporting SSE, AVX, and AVX2 instructions, and requires at least a CPU
with support for SSE2.

The Xeon Phi™ version of Embree only works under Linux in 64\ bit mode.
For compilation of the the Xeon Phi™ code the Intel Compiler is
required. The host side code compiles with GCC, CLANG, and the Intel
Compiler.
