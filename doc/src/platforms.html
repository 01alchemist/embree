<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

<p>Embree supports Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, each in 32bit and 64bit
modes. The code compiles with the Intel Compiler, the Microsoft
Compiler, GCC and CLANG. Using the Intel Compiler improves performance
by approximately 10%. Performance also varies across different
operating systems. Embree is optimized for Intel CPUs supporting SSE,
AVX, and AVX2 instructions, and requires at least a CPU with support
for SSE2.</p>

<p>The Xeon Phi&trade; version of Embree only works under Linux in 64bit
mode. For compilation of the the Xeon Phi&trade; code the Intel Compiler is
required. The host side code compiles with GCC, CLANG, and the Intel
Compiler.</p>
